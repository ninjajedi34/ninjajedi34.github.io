<p id="goal">Our goal is to teach kids, as young as fourth grade, the fundamentals of basketball.</p>

<p id="main">Who are we? We are the Sammamish High School Girls Basketball Coaches: Mike, Anna, and Becca. We want to start a program that allows young girls in the area to start exploring the sport of basketball. As well as get to know us coaches. We want to create a sense of community between the younger girls and the current high school players, who will be helping to lead a few clinics and camps during the year.</p>
